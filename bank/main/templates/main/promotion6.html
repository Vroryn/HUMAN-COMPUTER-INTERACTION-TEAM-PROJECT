           Indecisive on which bank to choose? We understand that the competition is fierce out there. </br>
    However at GFY banking, we offer easy transferring services to or from your account with us, just in case </br>
    the situation comes up. We offer a one day waiting period for exchanges when you take money out, but </br>
    we cannot really speak for the other guys when it comes to bringing money in.
